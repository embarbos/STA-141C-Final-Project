# song-popularity-analysis
Hello!

This repository contains the code and source files for the final group project for my STA 141C Class at UC Davis, taught by Dr. Bo Y.C. Ning. For this project, our group aimed to find which varaibles were most influential in indicating whether a song will be popular, using spotify song data.

Thank you!
